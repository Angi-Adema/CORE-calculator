# CORE-calculator

## Description

This calculator was designed to be incorporated into the contractorstartupclub.com website where users will have the ability to calculate their maximum hourly rate, minimum hourly rate, profit per hour and the flat rate price per job. This will assist users in bidding for jobs so they can provide accurate pricing on an hourly or a flat rate basis to their clients.

This calculator allows contractors to adjust their profit margins both on materials and on labor which will allow them to meet their sales goals. It also shows them their maximum hourly rate to maximize their profit and their minimum hourly or break even point rate.
